# Teaching Python

Weekly modules for CCE members to learn Python 3. Check out [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) to learn about what Python 3 is and what it is used for.

This tutorial will help you learn basic coding techniques. For those of you who do not have Python 3 installed and would rather use an online code editor, we recommend using [Repl.it](https://repl.it/). It's free and allows you to save your work online so that you can work on it wherever and whenever.

Each Level will contain a number of modules that will each teach you a specific topic. There will also be some projects for you to apply what you have learned in the modules.
