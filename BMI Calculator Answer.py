#Questions
#Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses person's mass and height to work out if one's weight is healthy.
#Make a BMI calculator using an if-else statement to measure if one's overweight or not.
#Hints
#1. unit for BMI is kg/m^2
#2. BMI calculation divides an adult's weight by their height squared
#3. usually BMI less than 25 is not overweight and the other is overweight

#Answer
#name = "Joon"
#height = 1.77
#weight = 73
#bmi = weight/(height**2)
#print("bmi: ")
#print(bmi)
#if bmi<25:
#    print(name)
#    print("is not overweight")
#else:
#    print(name)
#    print("is overweight")
