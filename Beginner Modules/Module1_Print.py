'''
Hello CCE Member!
    Thank you for your interest in learning about Python! May this module
    help you learn the basics of Python and become familiar with coding.
    We picked Python because it is a popular coding program and is easy to learn.
    Please take your time to reach out to our project manager if you need help
    with any coding!

    Below is a test program for you to play around with. Enjoy!

    God bless you all,
    Jeffrey Liew

# Hashtags are used to comment in your coding.
# It is important to comment to clarify your coding and what you did.

""" Multiline Comments
You can also use three single (') or double (") quotation marks to
create a multiline comment.
This can be useful if you want to describe a function or need a lot of
comments on consecutive lines.
However, the industry standard rarely uses this unless the number of lines
exceeds ~10 (not a set number but just my estimate).

# The print() function will make the computer write/print out whatever is within the parentheses.
# Write "Hello, World!" inside the parentheses and run the program.

print("")

# Congrats! You just wrote your first line of code!
# Next is "\n". When put inside the double quotations of a print statement,
# this will put the cursor on a New line (hence the "n"). In essence, this
# is the functionally the same as the "enter" key.
# Now, uncomment this line and put in a "\n" so that the two sentences are two lines.

#print("This is my second line of Python. I am learning Python for the Kingdom of God")

# You have now completed the basics of the print() function in Python.
# Continue on to the next module where you will learn about variables.
