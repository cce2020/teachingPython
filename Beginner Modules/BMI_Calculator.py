# When doing the Python modules, please do the problem on your own
#   before looking at the answer key. Feel free to use web (Stack Exchange
#   is a reliable source) or reach out to the project manager; Essentially,
#   the goal of these modules are to give you a small goal to help understand
#   Python by doing your personal research on something specific.

# Questions
# Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses person's mass and height to work out if one's weight is healthy.
# Make a BMI calculator using an if-else statement to measure if one's overweight or not.
# Hints
# 1. Unit for BMI is kg/m^2
# 2. BMI calculation divides an adult's weight by their height squared
# 3. Usually BMI less than 25 is not overweight and the other is overweight
