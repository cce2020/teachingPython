# Variables are used to store values.
# To declare a variable in Python, assign a value to a name.
# When coming up with a name, use something that is
# relevant to the use case of the variable.
# For example:

myVar = 5

# The variable myVar now holds the data type integer (int) value '5'.
# An int is any non-decimal number.
# Here are some other data types:

myFloat = 20.5	# A float is any decimal number.
myBool = True	# A boolean is either true or false.
myString = "This is a string"	# A string can contain any type and number of characters.
myList = ["string1", "string2", "string3"]	# A list contains a set of variables of the same data type.

# In Python, a variable can change to any data type.

myVar = False

# The variable myVar is now a boolean.
# You can also assign variables to other variables.

myVar = myString

# The variable myVar is now a string that contains whatever
# myString contains which is "This is a string".
# To print a string, use the print() function with the variable as the parameter:

print(myVar)	# Output: This is a string

# To print multiple variables in one print statement, separate the variables with a + sign.

print(myVar + myString)	# Output: This is a stringThis is a string

# To print multiple variables with a single space in between, separate the variables with a comma.

print(myVar,myString)	# Output: This is a string This is a string

# Other strings can be manually added to the print statement using the + sign.

print(myVar + ". This is a string.")	# Output: This is a string. This is a string.

# Printing variables will become one of the easiest and
# fastest ways to debug and find problems in your code.

# To test your understanding of variables, solve the following problem:

firstLine = "God is good."
secondLine = "All the time."

# 1. Print the following variables in 2 lines using 1 print statement.

# 2. Swap the 2 variables by assigning variables to other variables. You may create new variables.
# 	 DO NOT directly assign a string to the variable (i.e. firstLine = "All the time.")
