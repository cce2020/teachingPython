Hello CCE Member!
    Thank you for your interest in learning about Python! May this module
    help you learn the basics of Python and become familiar with coding.
    We picked Python because it is a popular coding program and is easy to learn.
    Please take your time to reach out to our project manager if you need help
    with any coding!

    Below is a test program for you to play around with. Enjoy!

    God bless you all,
    Jeffrey Liew

# Hashtags are used to comment in your coding
#   It is important to comment to clarify your coding and what you did
# Previously, I used 3 quotation marks to start and end my comment
#   That is used if I know I will write multiple lines to comment
#   This can be useful if you want to describe a function :)

name = input("\nEnter your name: ") # Asks for user input
                                    # \n is used to create a new line
print(name, "is beginning to learn Python for the Kingdom of God. \n") # Prints to text
